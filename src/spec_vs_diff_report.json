      "reason": "The diff summary shows no added PNG assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (only code/text files were added/modified), so the required image files are not evidenced as created.",

      "reason": "`backend/main.mo` is truncated before any of menuItemIds 46–53 are shown, so there is no evidence the seeded `imageUrl` values for items 46–53 were updated. Additionally, the new migration uses different filenames (`/assets/generated/dish-indian-*.dim_512x512.png`), suggesting the seeded values may also have been updated to non-specified paths or remain inconsistent.",

      "reason": "A migration exists and targets ids 46–53, but it updates them to different, non-requested filenames (adds `dish-indian-` prefix and different slugging for kanava/koonthal), so it does not meet the acceptance criteria of updating to the exact new `.dim_512x512.png` asset paths from Image Requirements.",
