  "summary": "The diff does not implement the core Sakthi Snacks image mismatch fix: no new corrected Sakthi image assets were added, the fallback mapping changes shown are not clearly updated to the specified Sakthi v2 filenames, and there are no backend seed/migration updates for restaurantId=7. Some unrelated mapping/documentation/state files were modified without being requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add corrected replacement Sakthi Snacks dish images under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` using the specified new filenames (e.g., `dish-sakthi-*-v2.dim_512x512.png`) and keep them as static frontend assets.",
      "reason": "Diff shows no added files under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (Added: 0) and no evidence of the specified `dish-sakthi-...v2...` assets being introduced.",

      "requirement": "Update `frontend/src/utils/imageFallbacks.ts` so Sakthi Snacks dish name mappings resolve to the corrected Sakthi Snacks image assets (including fixing wrong name-to-image mappings like unrelated items mapping to Sakthi assets).",
      "reason": "The visible portion of `imageFallbacks.ts` shows mappings like `'pani puri': '/assets/generated/dish-pani-puri.dim_512x512.png'` and `'bhel puri': '/assets/generated/dish-bhel-puri.dim_512x...'` but does not show updates to the specified Sakthi filenames (`dish-sakthi-...v2...`). The file is truncated, so full Sakthi mapping updates cannot be verified from the provided diff.",

      "reason": "No backend files were modified; there is no evidence of changes to `backend/main.mo` or any `backend/migration.mo` being added.",
