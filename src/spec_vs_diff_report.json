  "summary": "Frontend changes add robust restaurantId parsing/validation, safer React Query hooks, defensive list rendering, and safer error-message extraction to prevent runtime crashes when navigating to Restaurant Detail. However, no backend changes are shown for `getRestaurant` / `getRestaurantMenu`, so backend safety requirements appear unimplemented in this diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Ensure backend restaurant detail APIs (`getRestaurant` and `getRestaurantMenu`) handle missing/invalid restaurant IDs safely (returning `null` / empty list as appropriate) and do not trap.",
      "reason": "The diff summary contains only frontend changes plus utility additions; there are no modifications to `backend/main.mo` (or a new `backend/migration.mo`) demonstrating safe handling for nonexistent/invalid IDs or preventing traps.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary shows only frontend files added/modified; no backend files listed as modified/added."
