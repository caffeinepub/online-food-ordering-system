  "summary": "ICP full-stack food ordering starter app (React/Vite + Tailwind/shadcn-ui with Internet Identity auth; Motoko backend) now includes expanded seeded restaurant/menu data (Tamil Nadu + seafood items), restaurant and menu-item images via `imageUrl` fields with state migration/backfill, UI rendering of photos across restaurant list/detail pages with fallbacks, and an app-wide food-themed background.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind with shadcn-ui component library scaffolded and available for feature UI.",
    "Auth: Internet Identity used for login; authenticated UI enforced via RequireAuth and identity/actor hooks.",
    "Backend: Motoko canister includes modular authorization/access-control (mixin-style) integrated into main canister.",
    "Data access: Frontend uses typed canister bindings (.did -> TS) and a central actor hook for backend calls.",
    "State management: Cart is managed client-side via React context; orders/restaurants fetched via dedicated hooks.",
    "Images: Restaurant and MenuItem now include `imageUrl` fields end-to-end (seed/model/IDL/bindings/UI) with a conditional state migration to backfill pre-existing records.",
    "UI: Restaurants list and restaurant detail pages render image assets via a shared image component with fallback handling.",
    "Theming: App shell applies a global food-themed background with light/dark mode readability.",
    "Build template: `build-template/` now contains a complete multi-package scaffold (frontend + backend) with pnpm workspace config, extensive shadcn-ui components, custom ESLint rules, and image tooling scripts (resize/prune) for maintaining asset sets.",
    "Decision: auto-generate new images for the 5 North Indian menu items (Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Makhani, Jeera Rice, Butter Naan (2 pcs), Gajar Halwa) rather than sourcing specific provided photos."

  "known_issues": [
    "Some food/menu item images do not match their current item names (imageUrl/mapping mismatch), requiring immediate correction.",
    "Restaurant UI still shows incorrect images for some items/restaurants (imageUrl/mapping mismatch not fully resolved).",
    "Dosa menu item images are incorrect/need replacement; ensure correct images are used consistently across the application.",
    "Deployed UI still shows images as not visible (likely due to missing/incorrect imageUrl values or asset filenames not present at the referenced paths).",
    "Chennai Spice images are still imperfect/incorrect for some items; regenerate/improve the generated assets and update mappings so the UI shows the right images.",
    "Chennai Spice seafood menu items (Chepala Pulusu, Prawn Ghee Roast, Crab Masala/Nandu Kuzhambu, Kanava/Koonthal Masala, Fish Mappas, Fish Kola Urundai, Chemmeen Biryani, Andhra Fish Fry) currently need generated images or must be removed per user request."
